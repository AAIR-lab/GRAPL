Tarski
==================================

Tarski is a framework for the specification, modeling and manipulation of
`AI planning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_planning_and_scheduling>`_ problems.
Tarski is written in Python and includes parsers for major modeling languages
(e.g., `PDDL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_Domain_Definition_Language>`_,
`FSTRIPS <https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=566359>`_,
`RDDL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_Domain_Definition_Language#RDDL>`_),
along with modules to perform other common tasks such as logical transformations,
reachability analysis, grounding of first-order representations and problem reformulations.
