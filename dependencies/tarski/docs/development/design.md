## First-Order Logic

One of the aims of the package is to follow as closely as possible the textbook definition of 
the standard first-order logic constructs. 
In particular, we aim at keeping a clear _distinction between syntax and semantics_.
Here we should follow a separation-of-concerns approach and take advantage of the clean an elegant
design mathematical definitions. Our implementation should have a syntax layer and a semantic layer:

* _Syntax_ is concerned with the correct formation of the language constructs: terms, formulas, sentences, 
from the (lower-level) elements of the first-order vocabulary: connectives, quantifiers, variables, function and predicate symbols.

* _Semantics_ is concerned with the meaning assigned to these constructs: models (interpretations), their universes, 
the denotations of terms and truth value of formulas under any given model.
 
It is thus clear that as an ideal, the syntax module / layer of our implementation should have no knowledge about anything
pertaining to the semantic level: models, denotations, truth values, etc.


There is currently one major place where we violate this principle:

* The universes of discourse are currently conflated with the definition of constants. This is because at the moment it
is convenient for us to assume, Ã  la [Herbrand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbrand_interpretation), 
that we have as many constants as elements in the universe, and the other way around. Given the use
of the package within a planning context, this is also convenient for us because the (typed) universes of discourse
remain fixed throughout the planning process.
