Making the binary
"make" will generate the binary "drive"

Usage
drive -x x_coordinate_size -y y_coordinate_size

From our experience 
3 by 3 or less  problems are easy, e.g. "drive -x 3 -y 3"
6 by 6 or less  problems are medium, "drive -x 5 -y 5"
7 by 7 or more class problems are hard, "drive -x 7 -y 7"

Examples
We provide 5 easy problems, easy*, 5 medium problems, medium* 
and 5 hard problems, hard*.
These can easily be generated with "drive -x x -y y" commands.
