%%%%% Actual bibliography entries.
%
% Sorted by key.
%
% When adding new entries, please do not use tabs, but spaces
% instead. We have the following convention for keys:
% <authors>-<venue>
%
% For authors, if there are only two, we write out both names and
% connect them with -, if there are three or more, we abbreviate
% firstauthor-et-al.
%
% For books, venue is only the year of publication, for conference
% papers, this is the conference name together with the year, with
% no separator. For conference workshops, we append "ws" after the
% year, possibly together with an abbreviation. For arXiv, papers
% venue is arxiv not corr.
%
% Examples:
% pommerening-et-al-icaps2014 (conference paper)
% jonas-icaps2012wshsdip (often cited workshop with abbreviation)
% jonas-aaai2008wssearch (rarely cited workshop without abbreviation)
% jonas-nips2011ws (single workshop at the conference)
% russell-norvig-2003 (book)
%
% Please also follow the form of (most) of the existing entries,
% which is:
%
% <Type>{<key>,
%   author =       "Authors",
%   title =        "Title",
%   crossref =     "<key-from-crossref.bib-or-crossref-short.bib>"
%   etc.
% }
%
% Especially note that the keyword and "=" are separated by exactly one
% space, followed by as many spaces as required so that the actual
% entries start in column 18 (assuming counting based on index 1).
%
% Leave one empty line between two entries.
%
% Please add your name in brackets to any TODOs you insert. For example:
%
% TODO(John): add pages.
