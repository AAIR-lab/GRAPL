The lexer specification is in: 'rddl.lex'

The parser specification is in: 'rddl.cup'

To compile and build the parser, just use 'make lex'
followed by 'make parser' in the rddl.parser subdirectory.
Make sure that the OS-dependent options are enabled correctly
in the Makefile.

See INSTALL.txt in RDDLSim parent directory for more 
details.
